My interest lies in studying the behavioural ecology, evolution and cognition of group-living and social animals.  

I am currently working as a research associate in the Department of Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata, studying the behaviour and cognition of ants. Before this, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biology, IISER Tirupati, studying the behavioural ecology of Indian squirrels.  

I studied the behaviour of ants for my PhD thesis in the Department of Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata. I investigated different aspects of brood theft in an ant species.  

Apart from research, I keep myself busy in a lot of other activities. Painting is my hobby, and currently I am experimenting with digital media. In my leisure time, I try to learn coding and programming languages. I am very interested in data science and science communication, and have started writing blogs.
