## Interest

I am interested in studying the behavioural ecology of group-living and social animals. I am particularly fascinated by the impact of interactions between individuals and group-dynamics on decision-making and life history strategies, and plan to study behaviour, personality and cognition of the groups/socities.<br><br>

**Behaviour and cognition of ants**  
Investigating the role of memory for navigation in the context of nest relocation in a primitively eusocial ant *Diacamma indicum*. Studying the formation of working and long-term memory, as well as interrupting consolidation of memory to cause reduction in navigational efficiency in order to study the task performance and group dynamics.
